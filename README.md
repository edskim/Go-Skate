#Go Skate

This app serves as a dashboard for skateboarders. With this app, the user can track current and max speed, path, altitude changes, and other useful statistics.

Paths can be uploaded and shared with other skateboarders along with the user statistics for the paths and reviews for the path.

This app is geared toward longboarders, but can be expanded for cycling and other outdoor activities.
